Date, time, location, longitude, latitude, police force, road type, road class, number of casualties, speed limit, light conditions, weather conditions, urban or rural area are the some known information that I can use for my project.

One of the main purpose of this project is analyzing the conditions of accidents and related results. I want to visualize my analysis with graphics. More then, I want to make a model to predict outcome of accident under known conditions. \n",
