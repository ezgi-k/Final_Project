More then, I want to make a model to predict outcome of accident under known conditions. \n",

Also, you need to provide more details on the method. What machine learning algorithms are available for answering the questions you are asking. How are the methods you propose and the questions you ask are linked? How are they going to answer the questions? Finally, I need more details on the calendar: what are you going to do and when?"
